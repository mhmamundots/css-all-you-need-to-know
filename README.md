Welcome to the "CSS All You Need To Know" course! It's a completely free and open-source that provides you with all the source code for each lecture. You can watch all the videos on my YouTube channel called "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@mhmamundots">@mhmamundots</a>". You can also download each lecture's code from the course repository. 

If you're already familiar with HTML, this CSS course is perfect for you. However, if you're new to HTML, don't worry! There are many HTML playlists available on YouTube that you can learn from. If you prefer, you can request an HTML playlist in the comments on my YouTube channel, and I will try to create one for you.

To get the most out of this CSS course, watch the videos in order, use the code on GitHub, and join my Facebook group to discuss with other learners. I believe that by following these steps, you can learn a lot.

Visual Studio Code is a code editor, abbreviated as VS Code. We have many code editors, VS Code is the most popular among them.

Let's go to <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS Code's official website</a> to download it, and set it up on our machine/computer. Iâ€™m using Windows, I will download it for Windows. You can download it according to your operating system. You can follow any of the YouTube videos to download VS Code and install it on your computer. I hope you can do it.
